`bool` in C++ : any value other than 0 (or `false`) is true

### Loops
- Loops cause a section of your program to be repeated a certain number of times. The repetition continues while a condition is true.
- Syntax: 
  - for statement
    - initialization expression: only executed once, when the loop first starts
    - test expression: evaluated before the start of the loop body
    - increment expression: this is always executed at the end of the loop body
  - loop body: statement(s)
  
  TODO: while loop
